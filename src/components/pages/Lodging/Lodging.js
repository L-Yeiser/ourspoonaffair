        We have reserved the lodging at Cooper Spur, where we’ll also hold the
        rehearsal dinner, ceremony and reception. A restaurant on site offers
        food and drinks, and all cabins include full kitchens. There are two hot
        tubs and a fire pit on site, as well as access to trails. These
        accommodations require friends and family to share cabins. If you’re
        interested, we would love to have you join us. Let us know in your RSVP
        or drop us a line.
