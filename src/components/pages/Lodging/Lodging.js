      <h2>Cooper Spur Mountain Resort</h2>
      <p>
        We have reserved all of the facilities at{' '}
        <a href="https://www.cooperspur.com/">Cooper Spur Resort</a>,including
        the rooms, hoping that this allows the group more social time together
        and spares travelers from having to find and pay for a room at some
        off-site location. We’ll prioritize folks traveling from out of the
        region.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rooms are a mix of cabins, condos and more traditional hotel rooms.
        With limited space, we’ll be grouping guests together. An early RSVP
        will help us make those arrangements.
