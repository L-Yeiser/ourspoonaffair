      As we start this new chapter of our life together and move into a smaller
      space we&apos;re exploring ways to live more simply and leave a lighter
      footprint. We hope you&apos;ll consider investing your time to help us
      celebrate our commitment and our future. It&apos;s the single best gift we
      can image.

      This fall of 2020 we will road trip through the southwest United States,

      Eastern Oregon and below the cliffs of Yosemite, and soak in every hot
      spring along the way.
