      <h2>How We Met</h2>
      <p>
        Lauren and Kate met in the spring of 2017. When Lauren needed a pair of
        crampon to hike up Mount St. Helens, their mutual friend Julia suggested
        she reach out to Kate. They met on Kate’s front porch.
      </p>
      <p>
        We both knew early that we had found our best friend and the person we
        wanted to spend a lifetime with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kate fell for Lauren’s adventurous spirit and steady character. Lauren
        fell for Kate’s positivity and unflappability. People often joked at
        their similarities but they quickly realized they were similar in all
        the big and small ways that make life together easy — tidy at home, mild
        in conflict, moving at a hummingbird pace.

      <h2>Why Our Spoon Affair?</h2>
      <p>
        After one of their very early adventures, Kate ended up with one of
        Lauren’s spoons from a set of flatware her grandfather had given her.
        Kate, uncomfortable with displays of affection, kept Spoon{' '}
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ourspoonaffair/">as a way to tell</a>{' '}
        Lauren her feelings and it became a running joke.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spoon traveled down rivers, up mountains across the ocean. It went to
        silent meditation retreats, Christmas dinners Lauren’s family cider
        press, and the hospital. It was the only way in those early months that
        Kate could express all the corny things going on in her heart, like
        being on Mt. Hood on a blustery July day, and writing, “Tipped off
        balance by the wind. But nothing is more solid than my love for you.”
      </p>
