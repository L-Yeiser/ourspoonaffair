      <h2>Ceremony and Reception</h2>
      <p>4 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 5, 2020</p>
      <p>
        Cooper Spur Mountain Resort 10755 Cooper Spur Rd, Mt. Hood, OR 97041
      </p>
      <p>Attire: Northwest Dressy</p>
      <p>
        Not from the Northwest? “Dressy” around here means anything from
        Patagonia hiking pants paired with a puffy, to jeans and an oxford with
        Birkenstocks, from vintage dress to kilt to sequins. In short, we want
        you to be comfortable.
